' Red Ink Excel Add-in: Maintenance & Security Review Overview
' =========================================================================================
' PURPOSE
'   Provides AI-assisted text, document, and data processing inside Excel. Central entry
'   point is ThisAddIn.vb which wires UI elements, configuration, update checks, helper
'   modules, and cross-process automation bridges.
'
' CORE EXECUTION FLOW
'   1. ThisAddIn_Startup initializes threading context, update handler, custom task panes,
'      menus/ribbon bindings, configuration (via SharedLibrary), and feature modules.
'   2. User actions (Ribbon / context menu / drag & drop / VBA helper calls / pane UI)
'      funnel into command handlers (see ThisAddIn.Commands.vb) which route to processing
'      helpers (LLM calls, file/text transforms, worksheet insertion, CSV analysis, etc.).
'   3. Long-running or AI calls use async wrappers (LLM / PostCorrection) and marshal back
'      to the UI thread via EnsureUIThread().
'
' ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS (FILES)
'   ThisAddIn.vb
'       - Host add-in partial class; lifecycle (Startup/Shutdown); hardcoded constants;
'         global state; async LLM bridge; configuration bootstrap; exposes COM automation
'         entry via BridgeSubs; maintains undo cell states; initializes menus & panes.
'   VBA Helper
'       - A VBA-accessible module (external helper file/workbook) that invokes exposed
'         automation methods (e.g. via Application.COMAddIns(...).Object) for macro-based
'         integration; version checked against MinHelperVersion.
'   BridgeSubs.vb
'       - COM-visible automation surface (late-bound calls from VBA or external processes).
'         Provides restricted, parameterized access to safe subsets of add-in functionality.
'         SECURITY: Validate inputs (paths, prompts) to avoid injection or unsafe file IO.
'   DragDropForm.Designer.vb / DragDropForm.vb
'       - WinForms UI for drag & drop ingestion of files. Filters extensions (see
'         allowedExtensions) to constrain processing surface. SECURITY: Enforce whitelist,
'         reject large/binary/unsupported types; sanitize textual content before AI calls.
'   Form1.Designer.vb / Form1.vb (Excel)
'       - Main configuration/interaction window (settings, manual prompt execution, status).
'         Likely hosts controls for model selection, temperature, timeouts, etc. SECURITY:
'         Persist only necessary settings; avoid logging secrets/API keys in plain text.
'   Ribbon1.vb
'       - Defines custom Ribbon buttons and callbacks, dispatching user actions to command
'         handlers. Keep callbacks thin; delegate logic to Commands/Helpers modules.
'   ThisAddIn.Commands.vb
'       - Central command dispatcher; orchestrates user operations (summarize, shorten,
'         translate, markup insertion, batch processing). SECURITY: Validate spreadsheet
'         ranges & user-selected text; guard against over-large prompts (memory / API cost).
'   ThisAddIn.CSVAnalyzer.vb
'       - CSV profiling (delimiter detection, column stats, sampling). SECURITY: Stream
'         files instead of loading entire large datasets; handle malformed input robustly.
'   ThisAddIn.ExcelHelpers.vb
'       - Utility functions for range enumeration, cell value extraction, formula handling,
'         undo stack management, safe write operations. SECURITY: Avoid formula injection;
'         preserve previous state for rollback (undoStates).
'   ThisAddIn.FileHelpers.vb
'       - File IO abstraction (load/save text, PDF/RTF/HTML parsing). SECURITY: Enforce
'         allowedExtensions; normalize paths; avoid directory traversal; prefer read-only
'         access; treat external content as untrusted.
'   ThisAddIn.Helpers.vb
'       - General shared helpers (string transforms, prompt construction, token limits,
'         color parsing, extension-based routing). Keep pure & testable. SECURITY: Encode
'         user-provided text before embedding in markup/HTML contexts.
'   ThisAddIn.MenuContext.vb
'       - Builds legacy or modern context menus. SECURITY: Ensure commands are disabled
'         when selection state invalid; prevent accidental mass operations.
'   ThisAddIn.Pane.vb
'       - Manages CustomTaskPane instances (chat panel / insights). Handles lifecycle,
'         visibility, and cross-thread UI marshalling.
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.InsertIntoWorksheet.vb
'       - Writes AI-generated output back into a worksheet (cell-by-cell, batch, pane).
'         SECURITY: Strip control characters; guard against formula payloads; size checks
'         (LargeWorksheetSize).
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.vb
'       - Core transformation pipeline (invoke LLM, apply shortening, diffing, annotation,
'         bubble markup, context expansion). SECURITY: Rate-limit; timeout long calls;
'         segregate model/system prompts vs. user input; handle cancellation.
'   ThisAddIn.Properties.vb
'       - Centralized strongly-typed property/state access (current prompt mode, user
'         language, flags, feature toggles). SECURITY: Avoid storing secrets; thread-safety
'         for mutable shared state if accessed concurrently.
'
' EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
'   - Multiple third-party libraries (DiffPlex, Newtonsoft.Json, HtmlAgilityPack, PdfPig,
'     MarkDig, NAudio, Whisper/Vosk, gRPC, Google Cloud Speech, etc.) used unmodified except
'     MarkdownToRTF (modified). Review their licenses & update cadence; pin versions; ensure
'     no dynamic code execution surfaces (e.g., HTML parsing, audio transcription).
'
' THREADING & ASYNC
'   - Synchronization via WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext; EnsureUIThread() used after
'     async LLM calls to safely update UI. REVIEW: Confirm no deadlocks; prefer ConfigureAwait(False)
'     in library calls where UI not needed.
'
' SECURITY & REVIEW CHECKLIST
'   - Input Validation: All file paths, selected text, worksheet ranges, prompts.
'   - Resource Limits: Prevent oversized prompt or worksheet operations (LargeWorksheetSize).
'   - External Calls: Centralize API keys/config (do not hardcode); use timeouts/cancellation.
'   - Deserialization: Newtonsoft.Json usage must restrict to safe types (avoid TypeNameHandling.All).
'   - Temp / Disk IO: Sanitize filenames; avoid exposing arbitrary filesystem locations.
'   - Undo Integrity: Ensure undoStates cleared after destructive ops to avoid memory growth.
'   - Logging: Avoid writing sensitive data (user content, API tokens).
'
' MAINTENANCE NOTES
'   - Keep processing pure/business logic separate from UI (Commands vs Forms).
'   - Centralize constants (prefix triggers) to avoid divergence across modules.
'   - Consider extracting common code to SharedLibrary for Word/Outlook parity.
'   - Add unit tests for Helpers / ExcelHelpers / Processing transformations.
'
' QUICK START FOR REVIEWERS
'   1. Start at ThisAddIn_Startup to see initialization order.
'   2. Trace a Ribbon command -> Commands -> Processing -> InsertIntoWorksheet.
'   3. Inspect BridgeSubs for external surface & VBA entry points.
'   4. Audit FileHelpers & CSVAnalyzer for untrusted input handling.
'   5. Verify LLM wrapper (ThisAddIn.vb) enforces model/timeout policies.
