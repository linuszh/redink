' =============================================================================
' File: IWordDocumentHost.vb
' Purpose: Bridge so SharedLibrary can address the currently-open Word document
'          without taking a direct dependency on Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.
'          The Word host implements this; Outlook implements a stub.
'
' Operations (all SYNCHRONOUS by design):
'  - Read verbs: HasActiveDocument, ListOpenDocuments, GetActiveDocument,
'    ExtractText, SearchJson, ListComments (always available).
'  - Write verbs: InsertTextJson, ReplaceJson, AddCommentJson, FormatJson
'    (gated by WordHostPolicy.ActiveDocReadOnly).
'  - Host enforces read-only policy; COM/STA calls do not benefit from async.
