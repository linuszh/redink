' File: WebGroundingTool.vb
' Purpose: Shared host-internal web_grounding tool for Outlook and Word.
'          Exposes one tool definition that covers both standard web grounding
'          and deep research, depending on configured special-task models.
'          Executes using the same prompts and JSON-mode behavior as the
'          original Outlook AutoPilot implementation, while allowing host-
'          specific logging callbacks (e.g. AutoPilot dashboard).
