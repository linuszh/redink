' File: NativeMethods.vb
' Purpose: Provides minimal P/Invoke declarations for calling Windows (Win32) APIs
'          required by this library.
'
' Architecture / How it works:
'  - Exposes `Shared` (static) interop methods in a dedicated type to keep unmanaged
'    imports centralized and easy to audit.
'  - Uses `DllImport` to declare the native `user32.dll` function `SetForegroundWindow`.
