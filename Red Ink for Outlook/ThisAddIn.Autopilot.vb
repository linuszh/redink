' File: ThisAddIn.Autopilot.vb
' Purpose:
'   Inky AutoPilot — AI-assisted mail watcher for Outlook that monitors incoming
'   e-mails, applies sender/domain/subject policy filters, processes requests via
'   LLM (with optional tool-calling), and sends or stages replies.
'
' Architecture:
'  - Event-driven intake via Outlook `Application.NewMailEx`.
'  - Dual mode:
'      * AutoPilot: auto-send when policy permits.
'      * CoPilot: approval workflow for non-whitelisted senders.
'  - Trust boundary:
'      * Positive/negative filter rules (domain/sender/folder) are always enforced.
'      * Reply-To mismatch is logged as warning (processing continues).
'  - Loop prevention:
'      * Custom MAPI marker (`X-RedInk-AutoReply`) on sent replies.
'      * Subject/header auto-reply detection (OOF/DSN patterns).
'      * Per-sender cooldown, per-session reply limits, thread-depth limit.
'  - Conversation awareness:
'      * Detects prior AutoPilot participation via conversation traversal and
'        session fallback map (`ConversationID`) to support follow-up replies.
'  - Catch-up processing:
'      * On start, scans recent mailbox history since last processed UTC timestamp,
'        applies full filter pipeline, and offers operator selection dialog.
'      * Mails marked with holding-only MAPI value (`AP_LoopHeaderValueHolding`)
'        are re-eligible for full processing.
'  - Queue + timing:
'      * Central mail queue with processing pump.
'      * Attachment-based category classification (text/light/heavy-doc/heavy-pdf).
'      * Rolling timing estimates and queue position notifications for delayed jobs.
'      * Active-job progress notifications for long-running tool executions.
'  - Tooling integration:
'      * Uses existing `ExecuteToolingLoop` and AutoPilot internal tools.
'      * Supports per-mail `#model:` override with tooling-capability checks.
'  - Reply handling:
'      * Sends HTML replies with optional generated attachments.
'      * Optional approval dialog and "Sources used" footer.
'      * Moves AutoPilot replies to Sent Items\Inky Replies.
'  - Web grounding:
'      * When `EnableWebGrounding` is active, the system prompt informs the model
'        about its native web-search capability.
'  - Scheduler lifecycle:
'      * Starts/stops the scheduler timer (`StartSchedulerTimer`/`StopSchedulerTimer`)
'        alongside the AutoPilot session when `EnableScheduler` is configured.
'      * Manages a scheduler dashboard for task monitoring.
'  - Voicemail processing:
'      * When enabled, incoming voicemails are identified by sender address,
'        transcribed via the model's audio capability, and processed as instructions.
'        Responses are delivered to the mapped e-mail address from the caller ID CSV.
'
' Security Model for Attachments:
'  - Per-mail isolated temp directory under `%TEMP%` (GUID-based).
'  - Attachments and tool outputs are constrained to that directory.
'  - Result collection validates path-prefix containment before attaching outputs.
'  - Text caches are cleared after processing.
'  - Temp directory is deleted recursively in `Finally` (best effort).
'
' Licensing & Access:
'  - AutoPilot requires valid license state (`Private` or permitted `Pro` product).
'  - Additional user whitelist gate via `INI_AutoPilot` (`*` = all licensed users).
'
' Threading Model:
'  - Outlook COM access is marshaled to UI thread (`SwitchToUi`).
'  - LLM and queue operations run asynchronously with cancellation support.
'  - Dashboard updates are thread-safe through `LogWindow` invocation guards.
'  - Notification timer runs independently of processing pump for timely alerts.
