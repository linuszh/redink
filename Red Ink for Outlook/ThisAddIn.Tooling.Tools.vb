        "retrieve_web_content: Retrieves text content from one or more URLs. Use this to fetch information from websites when needed. " &
        "By default, this tool returns readable page text only. " &
        "OPTIONAL LINK EXTRACTION: If you need downloadable links such as PDFs, explicitly set include_links=true. " &
        "To discover links hidden behind collapsed accordions, tabs, or drop-down sections, explicitly set expand_interactive_sections=true. " &
        "Optionally set link_extensions to restrict extracted links to specific extensions such as ['pdf']. " &
        "When include_links=true, the tool returns the normal text plus a structured <LINKS_n> JSON block for each URL. " &
        "IMPORTANT BOUNDARY: This tool retrieves readable text and link metadata only. It does NOT download or preserve original binary file bytes. " &
        "If you call this tool on a direct PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ZIP, image, audio, or other binary URL, the result is text extraction or page content — not a real downloadable file object. " &
        "Therefore, NEVER use this tool as a file-downloader and NEVER save its returned text as if it were the original PDF or other binary file. " &
        "If the user wants the actual remote file saved into the workspace, use a dedicated binary download tool if available; otherwise explain that the current toolset can analyze the content but cannot save the original remote binary file. " &
        "IMPORTANT FALLBACK RULE: If include_links=true returns zero matching links, and the page may be dynamically computing or revealing links client-side, then use js_run as a fallback with allow_network=true and navigate_url set to that page. " &
        "In js_run, the code is already the body of an async function, so it must return the final value explicitly at top level. " &
