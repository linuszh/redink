' Red Ink – Architectural Overview (for maintenance & security review)
'
' PURPOSE
'   Red Ink is a Word COM/VSTO Add-in providing AI-assisted authoring, search, review, redaction,
'   speech (TTS/STT), transcription and document transformation features. It orchestrates Word UI
'   events, user prompts, external AI services and local processing utilities.
'
' HIGH-LEVEL LAYERS
'   1. Host Integration (Word object model, events, task panes, context menus, Ribbon)
'   2. Command & Orchestration Layer (user actions → pipelines)
'   3. Processing & Transformation (text, markup, diff, formatting, RAG, grounding, redaction)
'   4. Speech & Transcription (TTS/STT handling, language model bridging)
'   5. Web / External Services (LLM calls, auxiliary web agent, update mechanism)
'   6. Helpers & Utilities (file I/O, Word-specific helpers, JSON templating, state management)
'
' CORE ENTRYPOINT
'   ThisAddIn.vb
'       - Startup sequencing: attaches Word events, then runs DelayedStartupTasks once a document
'         context exists (avoids premature automation calls).
'       - Initializes configuration via SharedLibrary (SharedMethods.Initialize / InitializeConfig).
'       - Registers context menus (AddContextMenu) & periodic update checks (UpdateHandler).
'       - Exposes LLM(), PostCorrection(), and other bridges to SharedLibrary for central API usage.
'       - Manages asynchronous UI thread marshaling (EnsureUIThread + mainThreadControl).
'       - Maintains numerous constants (trigger tokens, feature switches, language/model lists).
'       - Holds transient state fields used by runtime prompt interpolation.
'       - Performs COM automation exposure (RequestComAddInAutomationService → BridgeSubs).
'       - Security-sensitive areas: HTTP listener (StartupHttpListener/ShutdownHttpListener),
'         external endpoints (OpenAI, Google, Whisper, Vosk), dynamic JSON template formatting code.
'
' HOST / WORD INTEGRATION
'   Word (implicit)              – Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word objects consumed throughout.
'   ThisAddIn.WordHelpers.vb     – Word-range/document manipulations (selection, insertion, cleanup).
'   ThisAddIn.WordSearchHelper.vb– Specialized search routines (clauses, hidden prompts, regex etc.).
'   ThisAddIn.Menu.vb            – Context menu creation & teardown; maps triggers → command handlers.
'   ThisAddIn.PaneAndMerge.vb    – Task pane orchestration, pane content updates, merge/view logic.
'   ThisAddIn.Slides.vb          – Document → slide generation utilities.
'   ThisAddIn.Redactions.vb      – Sensitive content detection & redaction application.
'
' UI COMPONENTS
'   Ribbon1.vb                   – Ribbon callbacks (buttons → Commands layer). Multiple partials
'                                  may exist to segregate feature groups (ensure all are reviewed).
'   Form1.vb                     – Main dialog or configuration/interaction form (general UI).
'   DragDropForm.vb              – Drag-and-drop ingestion (files/clipboard objects → processing).
'   ThisAddIn.TextToSpeech.Form.vb – UI for TTS settings, voice/model selection, playback controls.
'
' VBA / AUTOMATION BRIDGE
'   VBA Helper (external .dotm)  – Provides macro functions (e.g., CheckAppHelper) to validate helper
'                                  version or offer legacy automation tasks. Security: ensure trusted
'                                  location + signed macros.
'   BridgeSubs.vb                – COM-visible automation surface (exposed via RequestComAddInAutomationService)
'                                  enabling external scripts/macros to trigger add-in commands safely.
'
' COMMAND LAYER (User Intent → Pipelines)
'   ThisAddIn.Commands.vb              – Central dispatcher for high-level actions.
'   ThisAddIn.Commands.Freestyle.vb    – Freeform / ad-hoc prompt execution and content generation.
'   ThisAddIn.TextToSpeech.Commands.vb – TTS/STT specific commands (start synthesis, transcription).
'
' SEARCH / CONTEXT / RETRIEVAL
'   ThisAddIn.ContextSearch.vb         – Multi-source contextual search (library, document chunks).
'   ThisAddIn.SearchGrounding.vb       – Grounding retrieved context before LLM calls.
'   ThisAddIn.FileRAG.vb               – File-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (embeddings, chunking).
'   ThisAddIn.FindClause.vb            – Clause / structured legal text identification.
'   ThisAddIn.FindHiddenPrompt.vb      – Detection of hidden / obfuscated prompt injections (security).
'   ThisAddIn.DocCheck.vb              – Document diagnostics (integrity, version, compliance).
'
' PROCESSING / TRANSFORMATION
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.vb                    – Orchestrates multi-step pipelines (markup, diff, inject).
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.Comments.vb           – Bubble/comment extraction, formatting, pushback handling.
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.HTMLToWord.vb         – HTML → Word conversion (sanitization + formatting).
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.FormatSaveAndRestore.vb – Captures/restores formatting state around operations.
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.SearchGrounding.vb    – (See above) bridging search results into prompts.
'
' TEXT / DATA UTILITIES
'   ThisAddIn.FileHelpers.vb           – Safe file I/O, temp handling, path resolution, model file mgmt.
'   ThisAddIn.Helpers.vb               – Generic helper routines (parsing, mapping, template injection).
'   ThisAddIn.Properties.vb            – Configuration property wrappers (INI/env/registry abstraction).
'
' SPEECH / TRANSCRIPTION
'   ThisAddIn.TextToSpeech.vb          – Core TTS pipeline (Google, OpenAI, local fallback).
'   ThisAddIn.Transcriptor.vb          – STT/transcription (Whisper, Vosk, Google streaming).
'
' WEB / EXTERNAL INTERFACES

'   ThisAddIn.WebExtension.vb          – Bridges browser/extension requests to internal commands.
'   SpecialServices.vb (ThisAddIn.SpecialServices.vb)
'                                     – Ancillary external service tasks (e.g., update fetch, licensing).
'
' RESOURCES
'   Resources (resx / assets)          – Icons, localization strings, model metadata, license text.
'                                        Security: validate no embedded secrets; ensure license compliance.
'
' KEY DATA FLOWS
'   Word Events → ThisAddIn Startup → Menu/Ribbon & Pane Initialization → User Action →
'   Commands Layer → (Search/RAG/Processing) → LLM/TTS/STT/Web → Results Injection (markup, panes, doc).
'
' SECURITY / REVIEW HOTSPOTS
'   - External service calls (LLM/TTS/STT endpoints): validate secure transport (HTTPS / WSS).
'   - Dynamic code string (Code_JsonTemplateFormatter): ensure it is not compiled/executed unsafely.
'   - HTTP listener (WebAgent): restrict origin, sanitize inputs.
'   - Prompt injection & hidden content (FindHiddenPrompt.vb): confirm effective sanitization.
'   - File ingestion (DragDropForm, FileHelpers): path traversal & format validation.
'   - Macro bridge (VBA Helper + BridgeSubs): enforce version check & signed VBA project.
'   - Redaction logic: confirm irreversible removal when required.
