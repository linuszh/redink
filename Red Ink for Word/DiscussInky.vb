' File: DiscussInky.vb
' Purpose:
'   WinForms surface that hosts the "Discuss this" multi-persona chat inside Word.
'   Provides persona + mission selection, knowledge loading (file or directory),
'   optional inclusion of the active Word document, transcript rendering/persistence,
'   and LLM invocation with optional alternate-model / second-API support.
'   Includes two automation modes:
'     - Autorespond: simulates a second participant for multi-party dialogue
'     - Sort It Out: structured Advocate vs Challenger discussion using the same engine
'
' Architecture / How it works:
'  - UI Composition:
'     * WebBrowser transcript renderer (Markdown -> HTML via Markdig, custom CSS; external links open in browser)
'     * Multiline TextBox input with Enter-to-send (Shift+Enter for newline) and Esc-to-close
'     * Buttons: Send, Persona, Mission, Edit Local Persona Lib, Load Knowledge, Alternate Model,
'       Clear, Send to Doc, Close, Autorespond, Sort It Out, Tools
'     * Checkboxes: Include active document, Persist knowledge temporarily, Enable tooling, Tooling log
'
'  - Session State & Persistence (`My.Settings`):
'     * Persists window geometry, selected persona/mission, checkbox states, knowledge path, tooling settings
'     * Persists transcript in two forms:
'         - HTML fragment (`DiscussLastChatHtml`) for fast UI restoration
'         - Plain transcript (`DiscussLastChat`) to rebuild `_history` for LLM context
'     * Maintains an in-process runtime knowledge cache (`_cachedKnowledgeContent/_cachedKnowledgeFilePath`)
'       (survives closing/reopening the form while Word remains running)
'     * Optional temp-file persistence of knowledge when "Persist knowledge temporarily" is enabled
'       (`%TEMP%\redink-discussknowledge.txt`)
'
'  - Personas & Missions:
'     * Personas loaded from local and/or global persona libraries (Name|Prompt, `;` comments supported)
'       - Local personas are labeled "(local)" and display names are de-duplicated
'     * Missions loaded from a sibling file derived from the persona library filename:
'         [personaFileNameWithoutExtension]-missions.txt (Name|Prompt, `;` comments supported)
'     * Mission/Persona editing is available via the shared text editor; missions reload immediately
'
'  - Knowledge Loading (File/Directory):
'     * Loads a single file or all supported files from a directory (top-level only; capped to prevent overload)
'     * Supported formats include text/code/markup, RTF, DOC/DOCX, PPTX, PDF (optional OCR when available)
'     * When multiple files are loaded, wraps each into numbered tags:
'         <documentN name="file.ext"> ... </documentN>
'     * Produces a user-confirmed load summary (loaded/failed/ignored, PDF extraction warnings)
'
'  - LLM Pipeline & Context Unification:
'     * Builds prompts from shared context pieces:
'         - Persona system prompt (+ optional mission clause)
'         - Knowledge base (if loaded)
'         - Active Word document excerpt
'         - Conversation history (`_history`), capped/tail-truncated using `_context.INI_ChatCap`
'     * History roles:
'         - `user`
'         - `assistant` (main persona; Sort It Out stores prefixed display names like "X (Advocate): ...")
'         - `autoresponder` (second participant; stored already prefixed with its display name)
'       `BuildConversationForAutoResponder()` normalizes roles into a single transcript so both parties see the
'       full conversation regardless of who spoke.
'     * Generates a brief welcome message (persona/mission aware) and displays session info on startup when needed
'
'  - Automation Modes:
'     * Autorespond:
'         - Alternates between responder persona and main persona for up to N rounds
'         - Supports a stop phrase (`<AUTORESPOND_STOP>`) and optional progress UI
'         - Can optionally generate a discussion summary after completion
'     * Sort It Out:
'         - Runs a structured Advocate vs Challenger dialogue using the same alternation engine
'         - Missions can be auto-generated via LLM or selected manually; settings are persisted
'         - Can optionally generate a discussion summary after completion
'
'  - Model Selection / Tooling:
'     * Alternate model support:
'         - If an alternate model INI is configured, user can select an alternate model; the model is applied
'           only for the duration of each call and then restored (semaphore-protected)
'         - Legacy "second API" toggle is supported when configured
'     * Tooling support:
'         - Optional per-session tool selection and execution via `Globals.ThisAddIn.ExecuteToolingLoop`
'         - Tooling UI is enabled/disabled based on the currently selected model's tooling capability
'     * ToolTrigger "(t)" - One-Shot Tooling Model:
'         - Users can type "(t)" anywhere in their prompt to invoke a one-shot tooling request.
'         - The "(t)" token is stripped from the prompt before it is sent to the LLM.
'         - On detection, the model marked ToolDefaultModel=True is loaded from the alternate models INI
'           via GetSpecialTaskModel, without permanently altering context.
'         - The ToolDefaultModel config is captured (snapshot), the global context is immediately
'           restored, and the snapshot is applied temporarily only for the ExecuteToolingLoop call.
'         - If no tools are currently selected, the tool selection dialog is shown (forceDialog).
'         - Validation checks: INI path configured, ToolDefaultModel found, model supports tooling,
'           tools selected. Each failure reports an error to chat and restores the original prompt.
'         - Availability is checked at form load via IsToolDefaultModelAvailable(). When available,
'           session info includes a "(t)" usage hint.
'         - The one-shot model is never persisted — after the request completes, subsequent messages
'           use whatever model was previously active.
'
'  - Export:
'     * "Send to Doc" exports the conversation to a new Word document using Markdown insertion,
'       formatting speakers explicitly for `user`, `assistant`, and `autoresponder`
'
' External Dependencies:
'  - Markdig: Markdown-to-HTML conversion for transcript rendering and summary display
'  - `SharedLibrary.SharedMethods`:
'     * LLM calls and model configuration switching
'     * OCR/PDF utilities and file extraction helpers
'     * Shared dialogs (selection, variable input, message boxes, text editor)
'  - `Globals.ThisAddIn`:
'     * Word interop access, tooling loop, presentation extraction, drag/drop picker, progress UI helpers
